##  About Me

I'm deeply driven by understanding how systems break — and how to build tools that simulate, detect, and defend against those threats.  
From malware behavior to encryption, I explore the gray areas of code for educational and research purposes.  
Alongside cybersecurity, I also work on tools that help developers understand logic, algorithms, and systems more clearly.
